===========
This week is a little tough for me because I missed the section on 2013-09-10, 
I went over with installing Vagrant with my friend who went to the class. 
She gave the me the "raring-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1" 
which she said pretty took them the whole class to download. 
For me the most difficult part this week is that I could find no record of what happened in the 2013-09-10 section, 
which one of the delta that people suggested in the class was to have record of 
what we will cover in next class and also what we actually covered in the class.

The 2013-09-12 is an interesting section that it focuses on the "human" side of the
Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science instead of the technical side. 
The construction of reproducible, systematic groups where each member has 
clear responsibilities is crucial for making sure information will be directed to the right person at the right time, 
which can avoid confusion and misunderstanding like how we experience them 
when exchanging information across computers with different operation systems.

Although in terms of technical stuff, we didn't make any real progress in the 2013-09-12 section, 
but the lecture exercise and Eric Berlow: "Simplifying Ideas" really help us understand what this class is about.

I am looking forward to see how the deltas will be improved!

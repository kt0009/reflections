===========
Summary:
On Tuesday, we present in the order of group numbers.
The first person ran out of time, and never got to his get away.
For the second presenter, he mentioned his objective, but it's not on his ipython presentation.
However, he finished strong after the 30 sec warning is called. 
Group 5 uses the html5 to present in comparison to other groups so far.

I tried to use both html5 and ipython notebook to do a dual screen presentation, but Aaron's computer is
on presentation mode and behave kind of weird.

Group 7 gets rid of unicode from the file.
Group 8 has step by step procedure in a presentation style format and included major roadblocks/credit at the end.

Question: What are the cs skills needed behind those things?

Various types of graphs were used: scattered, bar, pie, violin, heat distribution....

Group 11: don't over think and be a perfectionist, just focus on reproducibility

On Tursday, we work on testing whether our projects are reproducible or not and did an pluses and delta

Reflections:
This week we finally produced some physical products and present them in class.
While the class is mainly about repoducible results, the students in this class came from 
very different backgreound and have distinct skill sets.
In the presentations, many of the groups assume all the students know R and use that a the analysis tool instead of ipython.
This is just like in the real world which people use their own tool to do their own analysis,
and right now we as a class are still working on learning common tools.
The process is difficult since we have a fairly large number of students in the class.

On Thursday we were testing the reproducibility of other group's work.
Some of the roadblocks I ran into are: can't copy and paste URL into the virtual machine, 
not having R on my computer so I can't test the R code Group 7 uses, and
one of the teammate was just fooling around and not doing anything.

I am still searching to find wasys to paste test into my virtual machine.

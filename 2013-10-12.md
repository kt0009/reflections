reflections
===========
O Tuesday, we present in the order of group numbers.
The first person ran out of time, and never got to his get away.
For the second presenter, he mentioned his objective, but it's not on his ipython presentation.
However, he finished strong after the 30 sec warning is called. 
Group 5 uses the html5 to present in comparison to other groups so far.

I tried to use both html5 and ipython notebook to do a dual screen presentation, but Aaron's computer is
on presentation mode and behave kind of weird.

Group 7 gets rid of unicode from the file.
Group 8 has step by step procedure in a presentation style format and included major roadblocks/credit at the end.

Question: What are the cs skills needed behind those things?

Various types of graphs were used: scattered, bar, pie, violin, heat distribution....

Group 11: don't over think and be a perfectionist, just focus on reproducibility


On Tursday, we work on testing whether our projects are reproducible or not and did an pluses and delta

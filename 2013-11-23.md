reflections
===========

This week I joined the heart group because my last group dissolved without giving me prior warning, and I took on the role as a curator, but our group is not doing much data cleaning.
In class group discussion is really useful since we can expect to meet all the members in the group, and don't have to go through the trouble of contacting each other to find a time to meet up.
Since we have large group, we have numerous SMART goals, and right I am in a four people subgroup with the goal of improving the graphs produced by the Quakers. However, we talked to the Quakers on Thursday and realize the graphs they previous produced are not their final product, and they are trying to improve them on their own right now, so our SMART goal seems redundant right now.
To try to figure out what else we can do, we scheduled an appointment to talk to Aaron today at 3pm. I arrived at 3:02 pm and was surprised to see that no one is there yet. I waited for a bit longer, and other group members show up, and I learned that this is not the first time Aaron disappeared without a warning.
In the coming weeks, I hope be more productive and find out new goals to approach.

Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

First of all, I had many things came up this Friday and weekends, 
so I forgot to do my reflection on time with no excuses.

This week we have two quest speakers coming in to chat with us on two different topics.
The first speaker on Tuesday showed us how to formulate the most solid argument with limited and inconsistent data.

With no quantitative data, the research team categorize toads' presence into "exist" versus "no existence" in each meadow.
Starting from there, the research team then can use the quantitative data they have such as location, temperature, 
nearest distance to the next meadow and other data to developed a model to predict toads' existence in a meadow that has not been surveyed.

This is a clever way to solve the technical difficulty of not able to count the exact number of toads in the meadow and
provide the best argument the research team can using the existing data, yet it makes me wonder that the conclusion could
be different if the exact number of toads is known.

I also thought the connectivity network between the meadows is a brilliant way to determine the influence of one meadow
to the whole toad population. It is a visual, simple, and powerful evidence.

The part showing weak correlation between the presence of horses versus toad population once again shows the
difficulty of not having sufficient data. The research team tried to overcome this weakness by testing out
different assumptions to reach the conclusion, showing that the conclusion is unlike to be wrong.

This is an interesting presentation, and I learned a lot from the clever ways the research team employed to overcome their difficulties.

For the Thursday lecture, professor delivers an powerful message questioning the validation of many statistical concepts.
If one is assumed in the first place, how can we use it to prove another assumed thing?
In contrast to Tuesday's presentation where the research group tackle their conclusion with carefully organized evidences,
the professor showed many examples of how people failed to provide a sound argument.

One big issue is the lack of official definition among those we are tackling the same problem.
This speech really brings me the importance of a common system where results can go thorgh and actually make progress.

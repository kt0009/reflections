reflections
===========

On Tuesday we exam the codes of the other groups.
It was difficult for me because it took a while for my virtual machine to start running,
and then unexpectively, I can't run the ipython notebook no-browser command for unknow reason.
I had to restart my virtual machine again, which again, took a while.
Moreover, I was the only one in my group that were in class on Tuesday, so there
is no one to collaborate with me, and I couldn't tell whether I was running into roadblocks on my own
or is group 7's work not reproducible since I have no one to compare to.

Group 11's project is really nice, it is thoughful, clear, and very presentable.
You can tell the members put efforts and more or less, each contributed.

I understand the theme of this class and like the idea very much,
but I think it's too difficult to put people with different background at the same page like this.
Some common training will be so much helpful. I suggest if you are teaching this class again in the future,
instead of designing "common procedure", it might be more helpful to design "training that will bring people to the common ground"

For Thursday, I sent in an email reporting absence for an interview.

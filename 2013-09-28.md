reflections
===========

Overall this Tuesday was confusing for me becuase I didn't get my ipython or vagrant to work,
then afterward as I went home and try to duplicate what happened in class, my stat157 virtual machine
crashed. As I tried to create a new virtual machine, I realized I couldn't remember all the codes I
entered into my virtual machine and I can not find a complete log of everything we have installed
both on our computer and the virtual machine.
So I support what one student said on Friday, create some sort of log that will enable students
to work on or catch up on their own if they want to explore more or miss anything in class.

Thursday's lecture is interesting, it helps me understand the theme in this class.
Just like maany others, I signed up for the class becuase I wanted to have exposure to all the programs
listed in the course description. I decided to stay after hearing the first class becuase I thought the 
idea of creating "repeatable" and "reproducible" work is interesting.
Yet as an undergrad who has little experience in research, I didn't understand the importance of the idea till
Thursday. Different versions of different software on different computer systems make it difficult to perform 
analysis that is repeatable on all platforms.
In the ruler story, when measuring a room, people will get similiar result despite what brand of rulers they use.
This is becuase a common system has been created, and everyone can exchange information properly with the established system.
However, this doesn't seems like the case in the world of data science.
There are just too many different factors in the computers to lead to various issues when trying to perform the
same analysis on different systems.

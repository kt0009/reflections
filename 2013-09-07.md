===========

For me, the first challenge for me this week is getting familiar 
with all the websites and programs that I never use before.

Things such as IRC, Freedly, even Twitter are all new to me, and 
learning how to navigate them is a small challenge.
Github is the most challenging of those, the idea of forking and pull requests
make sense, yet how to actually navigate them familiarly is difficult.

To resolve those challenges, I simplify take my time following the instruction carefully and
google whatever questions I have, such as "how to set up an IRC account"
Nevertheless, I need more time navigating those programs and websites to get familiar with them.

Besides those more minor issues that can be dealt with through more useage,
one real chanllenge I have is the fact that I can not connect to Air Bear 2, even after
Kristina took a look on my computer and tried to fix it during the lecture on 2013-09-05.

Also, depsite the fact the there is record what each lecture should cover.
It will be nice to have a record of what we actually recovered in class and what was
left out and should be completed at home.

Suggestion on class annoucement:
I have an 8 am class, and I am sure there are other students that also do.
It is difficult for us to check the class annoucement in the morning before we walk into the class.
Can you instead send them the night before?

Lecture on Tuesday define very specific roles for people who work on different stages in the research progress.
It seems like a good system for big research groups to collaborate both vertically and horizontally,
yet I feel in a small group setting, having such definite role for each member will not be as effective.

In a large group, communication between different sectors can be chaotic,
and there is a lot of internal collaboration within each sectors.
However, in a small group, communcation will not be as difficult, and having overlaping roles may be helpful.

Thursday:
Earthquake prediction using: Poisson, Brownian passage time, and 'time-predictable'
Result is a number, but....it's not probability.
They equates frequencies with probabilities, models upon models, inconsistent and virtually opagque.....
too many assumptions.

Earthquake probability is a metaphor.
Claims that events occur as if in a casino game
Arguments about the rules of the game
Why is it like a casino game
Why not like terrorism instead

Testing predictions
some predictions hold "by chance"   (with luck, the method will fit)
can't conclude a method has merit just because some predictions come true
How to evaluate? Ideas from hypothesis testing
Chance model for successful predictions: Does method succeed 'beyond chance'?

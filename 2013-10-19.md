Evaluation Mechanisms in Ptolemy" by Chris Shaver

Useful programs: svg graphs, html5 presentations
Easy to edit, small in size(all text), easily transfer to java or html

We need format that can last and reproducible in the future.
Miscrosoft Word is not readable with other programms.

Concept of "generate" instead of product.
Ex.A vector graph that's generated, can change easily VS. A picture done with Adobe Photoshop

CSEP, an earthquake study website that tries to make everything reproducible.
Their reproducible procedure requires to download 30G of space and lengthy procedure that you can't copy and paste.

Ipython Notebook presentation by Aaron
Relying on live data can be dangerous: data updates, shutdown, program updates
- Extract eathquake data from CSEP
- Dropping Nan, how to drop? The row or cloumn, use "dropna" to filtered data
Important to save new data as a new name.


Useful to know "JSON vs. Python Syntax"

Open Knowledge Foundation: BibServer

Assignment: For Curation and Visualization, if in the other groups, pick one to join.

Use models and data to create open access data.
People can build apps and write codes to share.

Prof. Stark "Magnitude-dependent Automatic Alarms"
What are the neccessary conditions for us to be able to predict earth quakes.
- Poisson. Clearly doesn't fit: too little clustering
Physics, data, declustered data all does not support Poisson

What we'll try to do: Automatic Alarms and MDAs
- Automatic alarm: after every event with M > mu, start an alarm of certain duration
- Magnitude-dependent automatic alarm(MDA): after every event with M > mu, start an alarm of duration phi (u)^M
1 free parameter (u)
For both, adjust fraction of time covered by alarms through phi
- optimal ETAS predictor: level set of conditional intensisty
- ETAS has 4 free parameter
